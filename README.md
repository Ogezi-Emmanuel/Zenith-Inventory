### Zenith Inventory

**Zenith Inventory** is a smart invoicing and inventory management web application designed for **small business owners, freelancers, and entrepreneurs in Nigeria**. It simplifies the process of tracking products and billing clients, which matters because it automates tedious financial tasks, reduces manual errors, and frees up valuable time for business owners to focus on growth. The AI integration provides proactive insights, like flagging low-stock items before they run out.

### üß† AI Integration Strategy

My strategy is to embed AI assistance across the entire development lifecycle, from initial coding to final documentation.

#### Code Generation
My primary AI tool for code generation will be my editor, **Trae**. I will use it to scaffold repetitive and boilerplate-heavy features. For instance, to create the "Add New Product" page, I will prompt the AI to generate the entire React component, including a form with input fields for product name, price, and stock quantity, along with the necessary state management hooks and Tailwind CSS classes for styling.

#### Testing
I will use AI to accelerate the creation of robust tests. After writing critical business logic, such as a function that calculates an invoice's total including 7.5% VAT, I'll provide the function's code to the AI assistant. I will use a prompt like: *"Generate a Jest test suite for this function. Include tests for valid inputs, zero values, and edge cases to ensure accuracy."*

#### Documentation
AI will be my assistant for maintaining clear and comprehensive documentation.
* **Docstrings**: For complex backend functions (e.g., a database transaction for updating stock levels), I'll prompt the AI to generate detailed JSDoc comments explaining the function's purpose, parameters, and return value.
* **Inline Comments**: I will use the AI to add concise, clarifying comments to non-obvious lines of code.
* **README**: I'll have the AI draft sections of the `README.md` file, such as creating a feature list or generating setup instructions based on the project's `package.json` file.

#### Context-Aware Techniques
My core context-aware strategy revolves around the **Supabase database schema**. Within my editor, **Trae**, I will ensure the AI has access to the TypeScript types automatically generated by Supabase. When I need to write a complex query‚Äîlike fetching an invoice along with its related customer and product details‚Äîthe AI will understand the table relationships, foreign keys, and column names, allowing it to generate accurate, type-safe database calls. Furthermore, during pull requests on GitHub, **CodeRabbit** will use the context of the `git diff` to provide intelligent code reviews.
